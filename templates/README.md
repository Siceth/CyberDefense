# Templates


## Usage

Several inject response templates are available for quick duplication and form-filling whilst delivering an aesthetically pleasing result. The responders simply need to specify the *recipient* and *subject* (inject name). Other fields will auto-populate.

 - **Inject_Response.docx** is for any typical, open-ended response.
 - **Inject_Response_AllMachines.docx** is specifically for injects that ask for information from all machines.
 - **Inject_Response_Failed.docx** should only be used as a last-resort in case we can't get a satisfactory response in.
 - **Incident_Response.docx** is exclusively for reporting red team presence on any machines.

Do ensure the result is exported as a PDF for professionality reduced file size.


## MOTD

The motd.txt file serves as a quick resource or reference to implement in systems.
*TODO*: add per-system commands for quicker usage


## Other stuff

 - **ccdc.xml** is just for the response templates; it's not useful on its own.
